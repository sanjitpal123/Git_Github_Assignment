
Q1. Explain what version control is and its importance in software development.


Ans:-  Version control, also known as source control or revision control, is a system that records changes to a file or a set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It allows multiple contributors to work on a project simultaneously and keeps track of changes made to the source code, documentation, and other files associated with a software development project.

Here are the key components and Importace 

Repository:

A repository is a central location where all the files and their versions are stored.
It can be local (on an individual developer's machine) or remote (on a server, often accessible to multiple developers).


Commit:
A commit is a snapshot of the project at a specific point in time.
Developers make commits to record changes they've made to the codebase.


Branch:
A branch is a separate line of development that diverges from the main codebase.
Developers can create branches to work on features or bug fixes independently without affecting the main code until they are ready to merge their changes.

Merge:
Merging is the process of combining changes from one branch into another.
It is often used to integrate features developed in separate branches back into the main codebase.

Conflict Resolution:
Conflicts may arise when two or more developers make changes to the same part of a file simultaneously.
Version control systems provide tools to resolve these conflicts, ensuring a smooth integration of changes.
Importance of Version Control in Software Development:

Collaboration:
Enables multiple developers to work on the same project concurrently.
Provides a mechanism for developers to merge their changes and maintain a coherent codebase.

History and Accountability:
Maintains a complete history of changes made to the project.
Each commit includes information about who made the change, when it was made, and what changes were introduced.

Reproducibility:
Allows developers to roll back to previous versions of the code if issues arise.
Enhances the ability to reproduce specific states of the project.
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):
